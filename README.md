This is a list of organisations in the UK licensed to sponsor migrants under Tiers 2 &amp; 5 of the Points-Based System

The Home Office provides a list of licensed organisations that are eligible to sponsor non-EU workers. The list is huge and contains more than 30,000 records and is provided in pdf format which makes it very difficult to carry out any search. The aim of this app is to make it slightly easier for job seekers to filter employers by their locations and carry out google search on the companies.
